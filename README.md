# goit testing task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

**Goal: Create tweet cards and add interactivity at the click of a button.**

1. The users resource was created using https://mockapi.io/projects/6469ebed183682d614493d60 and saved in the data file.
2. One pagination page displays 4 tweets, the rest are loaded when you press "Load More" button.
3. User actions are stored in local storage.
4. Created routing using React Router with two pages: Home and Tweets.

Libraries were used:
